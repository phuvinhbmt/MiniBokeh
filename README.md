# MiniBokeh - Bokeh dashboard
> This project is a dashboard visualizing data about relation between fertility, population, child mortality and gdp in some regions overtime with Bokeh interactive plotting. 

## General info
This is an exercise from Datacamp sourse: Interactive Data Visualization with Bokeh at 'https://www.datacamp.com/courses/interactive-data-visualization-with-bokeh' ' with some modifications, adding more Bokeh interactive models. I use this project as a way to summarize my skills after 2 months of studying Python for Data science.
